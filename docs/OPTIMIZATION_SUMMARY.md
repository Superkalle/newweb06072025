# Optimization Summary for Cockpit4me Headless Website

This document summarizes the optimizations implemented by the AI agent to enhance the Cockpit4me headless website, focusing on API access and content optimization for improved readability, SEO, and user experience.

## 1. API Improvement for Portfolio Access

The WordPress API integration has been significantly refactored and centralized in `lib/wordpress.ts`.

### Key Changes:
- **Centralized Fetch Functions:** Dedicated functions (`fetchPortfolio`, `fetchServices`, `fetchBerater`, `fetchPosts`, `fetchCategories`, `fetchTags`) are now used for data retrieval, replacing scattered `fetch` calls.
- **Enhanced Data Structures:**
    - `WordPressPortfolio` interface now includes `portfolio_categories: number[]` and `tags: number[]`.
    - `WordPressBerater` interface has been introduced in `lib/wordpress.ts` with `portfolio_categories: number[]` and `tags: number[]`.
- **Automated Term Mapping:** `fetchPortfolio` and `fetchBerater` functions now automatically map `_embedded['wp:term']` data to the `portfolio_categories` and `tags` arrays within the returned objects, ensuring consistent data structures.
- **Category Filtering:** `fetchPortfolio` and `fetchBerater` now support filtering by `portfolio_category` ID.
- **Component Refactoring:**
    - `components/Portfolio.tsx`: Refactored to use `fetchPortfolio` and `fetchCategories` for dynamic filtering and display of portfolio items.
    - `components/PortfolioDetail.tsx`: Refactored to use `fetchPortfolio`, `fetchCategories`, and `fetchTags` for single item display and related projects.
    - `components/Services.tsx`: Refactored to use `fetchServices`.
    - `components/BeraterPortfolio.tsx`: Refactored to use `fetchBerater`, `fetchCategories`, and `fetchTags` for consultant listings and filtering.
    - `components/Blog.tsx`: Refactored to use `fetchPosts` and `fetchCategories`.

## 2. Content Optimization (Readability, SEO, User Attention)

Technical improvements have been made to enhance content discoverability and presentation.

### Key Changes:
- **Structured Data (JSON-LD) Implementation:**
    - `components/Features.tsx`: Added `ItemList` schema markup for `Service` items.
    - `components/Services.tsx`: Added `ItemList` schema markup for `Service` items.
    - `components/BeraterPortfolio.tsx`: Added `CollectionPage` with `ItemList` of `Person` schema markup for consultant profiles.
    - `components/Blog.tsx`: Added `CollectionPage` with `ItemList` of `BlogPosting` schema markup for blog posts.
- **Dynamic Metadata:**
    - `app/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx`: `generateMetadata` function now dynamically fetches portfolio item data to set SEO-friendly titles, descriptions, and Open Graph/Twitter card metadata.
- **Image Optimization:**
    - All `<img>` tags in `components/Portfolio.tsx`, `components/PortfolioDetail.tsx`, `components/Services.tsx`, `components/BeraterPortfolio.tsx`, and `components/Blog.tsx` have been replaced with Next.js `Image` component for automatic optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, WebP conversion).

## 3. Remaining Optimization Opportunities (Requires User Input)

The following points from the initial optimization plan require further information or strategic decisions from your side:

### 3.1. Internal Linking Strategy
While `next/link` is used where possible, many links currently point to external WordPress URLs or are placeholders (`href="#"`). To fully leverage internal linking for SEO and user experience, these need to be mapped to internal Next.js routes.

**Action Required:** Provide a mapping for the following links to their corresponding internal Next.js paths or confirm if they should remain external:
- **`components/Hero.tsx`:** "Kostenlos starten", "Demo anfordern" buttons.
- **`components/Services.tsx`:** "Mehr erfahren" on service cards, "Alle Services" button.
- **`components/BeraterPortfolio.tsx`:** "Profil ansehen" on consultant cards, "Team kennenlernen", "Kontakt aufnehmen" buttons.
- **`components/Blog.tsx`:** "Weiterlesen" on blog post cards, "Zum Blog" button.
- **`components/Footer.tsx`:** All placeholder links (Services, Company, Legal, Social Media). For social media, provide the full external URLs.

### 3.2. WPGraphQL Integration
This is a significant architectural change that can offer more flexible and efficient data fetching.

**Action Required:** Confirm if you wish to proceed with evaluating and implementing WPGraphQL. This would involve:
1.  Installing and configuring the WPGraphQL plugin on your WordPress backend.
2.  A complete refactoring of the API-Abrufschicht in `lib/wordpress.ts` to use GraphQL queries instead of REST API endpoints.
